# Python Try Except

# IMPORTANT:
"""
The `try` block lets you test a block of code for errors.

The `except` block lets you handle the error.

The `else` block lets you execute code when there is no error.

The `finally` block lets you execute code, regardless of the result of the try- and except blocks.
"""


# Exception Handling:

# When an error occurs, or exception as we call it, Python will normally stop and generate an error message.

# These exceptions can be handled using the `try` statement:

# Ex:
# The `try` block will generate an exception, because `x` is not defined:
try:
    print(x)
except:
    print("An exception occurred")

# Since the try block raises an error, the except block will be executed.

# WARNING: Without the try block, the program will crash and raise an error:


# Many Exceptions:

# You can define as many exception blocks as you want, e.g. if you want to execute a special block of code for a special kind of error:

# Ex:
# Print one message if the try block raises a `NameError` and another for other errors:
try:
    print(x)
except NameError:
    print("Variable x is not defined")
except:
    print("Something else went wrong")


# Else:

# You can use the `else` keyword to define a block of code to be executed if no errors were raised:

# Ex:
# In this example, the `try` block does not generate any error:
try:
    print("Hello")
except:
    print("Something went wrong")
else:
    print("Nothing went wrong")


# Finally:

# The `finally` block, if specified, will be executed regardless if the try block raises an error or not.

# Ex:
try:
    print(x)
except:
    print("Something went wrong")
finally:
    print("The 'try - except' is finished")


# NOTE: This can be useful to close objects and clean up resources:

# Ex:
# Try to open and write to a file that is not writable:
try:
    f = open("demofile.txt")
    try:
        f.write("Lorum Ipsum")
    except:
        print("Something went wrong when writing to the file")
    finally:
        f.close()
except:
    print("Something went wrong when opening the file")

# The program can continue, without leaving the file object open.


# Raise an exception:

# As a Python developer you can choose to throw an exception if a condition occurs.

# To throw (or raise) an exception, use the `raise` keyword.

# Ex:
# Raise an error and stop the program if x is lower than 0:
x = -1

# if x < 0:
#     raise Exception("Sorry, no numbers below zero")


# The `raise` keyword is used to raise an exception.

# You can define what kind of error to raise, and the text to print to the user.

# Ex:
# Raise a TypeError if x is not an integer:
x = "hello"

# if not type(x) is int:
#     raise TypeError("Only integers are allowed")
